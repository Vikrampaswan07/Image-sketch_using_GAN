# Image-sketch_using_GAN
This project aims to implement image to sketch generator model using GAN.

Below are the steps to implement our model

1.Open the github link below and run the code in Google Colabs: 
  https://colab.research.google.com/github/Vikrampaswan07/Image-sketch_using_GAN/blob/main/Image-to-sketch_using_GAN.ipynb.
	
2.Run the first cell to clone the required directories and libraries. Once you run this code you should see a directory named Image-to-sketch-using-cycle-GAN.

3.Run all the shells one by one.

4.In the shell named-"Train the network", apply the input image path.

5.Enter the input image in the second last shell.

6.Run the last shell to get the desired sketch of input image.
